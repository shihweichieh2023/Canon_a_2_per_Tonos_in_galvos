# Canon_a_2_per_Tonos_in_galvos
This patch generate a test projection pattern for a DSSC panel to receive and convert the 2 dimentional projection to 1 dimentional audio stream. The content of the laser projection was generated with arduino code, it is a period of melody of Canon a 2 per Tonos of Bach. Two notes are converted into frequencies and sent to the x and y galvanometers at the same time as polynotes, so you can "see" and hear one polynote in one laser pattern. The reason to pick Canon a 2 per Tonos of Bach is I like Douglass Hofstadter use this song in his book "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" (GEB) to explain the "strange loop".  ![IMG_0824](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3befbdf8-f44b-414b-a3cc-56e1ec77536a)
